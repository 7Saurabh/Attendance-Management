database has been fixed!
now there are two tables rather than one 
one table { name: User } will be for temporary use { to take data of one day }
another table { name : attendance } will be for permenant data of Students 
first table have this columns { id username password attendance }
second talbe have this columns { date ids }

# Now i have made subject option to choose while marking the attendance


HAVE TO DO 
1. add reset route to any code which will just make to restart the route. (cause onece the route has been restarted it will
automatically check if date has been changed or not, and accordingly does his job)
    It can be triggered when date been changed 
    or with any route.

2. If you have to reset db means add today's date to db access "resetUserDB" route. It will reset and add new date and redirect 
to "register" route.
